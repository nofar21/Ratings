# Rating page
# This project is designed according to Toki (1st assignment). 
# In the beginning there is an empty list of ratings.

# For the user to know what is the purpose of the page, a "More About..." button
# tells the user that it is indeed a rating page and what is the rating about.

# In order to add a rating, please press on the "Create New" button.
# There is a requirement to fill every field, names (25) and feedback (35) are limited in size.
# To make the client choose a number from 1-5 (and prevent other options),
# the Rate Number field is an opening list.
# As the rating is sent (all fields were filled) the item is added to the table (list).
# The average of the ratings in list will appear.

# In each rating's field "Action" three buttons will appear:

# "Info" button- will present the info about the specific rating.
# There is a return button, to go back to ratings' list.

# "Edit" button- will present the creating screen with the values of sent rating.
# While editing, all fields still have requirement to be filled.

# "Delete" button- will present screen with the info about the specific rating.
# If the user wants to delete, they should press the "Delete" button, below rating info.
# If user regrets, a "Return" button above will show the list screen once again.

# In order to search rating, please press on the "Search" button.
# It will search the phrase in the feedback field.
# When the "Search" button is pressed will no input, it will show all the ratings.
# If user regrets, a "Return" button below will show the list screen once again.
